Text to 3D API is a feature that allows you to integrate Meshy's Text to 3D capabilities into your own application. In this section, you'll find all the information you need to get started with this API.

The workflow of Text to 3D involves two stages: the preview stage and the refine stage. In the preview stage, a base mesh is generated with no texture applied, allowing you to evaluate the geometry. In the refine stage, the preview mesh is textured based on the text prompt.

## [The Text to 3D Task Object](https://docs.meshy.ai/api/text-to-3d#the-text-to-3d-task-object)

The Text to 3D Task object is a work unit that Meshy keeps track of to generate a 3D model from a **text** input. There are two stages of the Text to 3D API, `preview` and `refine`. Preview stage is for generating a mesh-only 3D model, and refine stage is for generating a textured 3D model based on the preview stage's result.

The object has the following properties:
